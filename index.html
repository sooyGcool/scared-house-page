          You are a character named Mike. You decide to go camping in the forest
          at night. It is already late, so you prepare your campsite. It is very
          late, so you decide to sleep. You wake up to some chilling and
          terrifying screams. You are very scared, so you decide to grab
          everything and go to another place. You leave and on the way, you see
          a mysterious and abandoned house that is a little scary. <span id="house">You decide to
